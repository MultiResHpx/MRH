*** MultiResHpx DEPENDENCIES ***

MultiResHpx is pretty much a standalone code that only depends on the user acquiring and
building GeographicLib-1.51 available at (https://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/files/distrib/)

In particular the user must build x64 at least the Geographic.lib library.

MultiResHpx was built and tested in x64 with Visual Studio 2017 and a VS15 solution and project files
are included in this distribution within the /platform directory. 

To get started, after Geographic.lib has been built, modify the START_MultiResHealpix.bat file to update
appropriate location of GeographicLib-1.51. Run START_MultiResHealpix.bat to properly load the VS15 
solution file. 

First build MultiResHpx, and if successful then build each of the accompanying Example projects that
demonstrate how the various MultiResHpx Query's work as well as a few other features of MultiResHpx.
